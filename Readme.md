#Workout Log assignment

~~Everything on this was actually going very well unti just now (Monday @ 7:30). I started getting a forbidden error and I"m struggling to find out why.~~

#Update 9:05

I worked through this. This was an authorization error. Now I'm getting a new error. I'm able to create the logs, but unable to get the id.

That said, everything was working fine up to that point.
