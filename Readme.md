# Workout Log assignment

~~Everything on this was actually going very well unti just now (Monday @ 7:30). I started getting a forbidden error and I"m struggling to find out why.~~

# Update 9:05

I worked through this. This was an authorization error. Now I'm getting a new error. I'm able to create the logs, but unable to get the id. Everything in my database is also a double entry which seems like a really fun bug.

# Update 10:57

Took a break for a bit and still unable to proceed further without figuring out this issue. I really thought I had an idea or two for it.

That said, everything was working fine up to that point.
